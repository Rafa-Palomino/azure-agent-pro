## 🛠️ Advanced Copilot Techniques

### 1. Context-Aware Development

**Before asking Copilot:**
1. Open relevant files in your workspace
2. Include resource naming conventions in comments
3. Add environment context (dev/test/prod)
4. Reference related Azure services

**Example:**
```bicep
// Context: Production environment
// Naming convention: company-env-location-service-purpose
// Related services: Key Vault, App Service, SQL Database
// Compliance: SOC 2, HIPAA

param storageAccountName string = 'contosoprodeuststorage'
```

### 2. Incremental Refinement

Start with basic prompts and refine:

**Initial:**
```
Create a storage account in Bicep
```

**Refined:**
```
Create a production-ready storage account Bicep template with:
- GPv2 with hot/cool tiers
- Private endpoints
- Lifecycle management
- Encryption with customer-managed keys
- Diagnostic logging
- RBAC assignments
```

### 3. Documentation-Driven Development

Include documentation requirements in prompts:
```
Generate a Bicep module with comprehensive documentation including:
- Parameter descriptions
- Usage examples
- Security considerations
- Cost implications
- Troubleshooting guide
```
