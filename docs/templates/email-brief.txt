Subject: Root Cause Identified - 8 Orphaned Transactions Blocking Space Reclamation

Hi team,

We have identified the root cause of the storage growth issue:

FINDING:
8 orphaned transactions (session_id = NULL) active since November 12, 2025 (47 days ago) are blocking 1,240 GB of space reclamation.

DETAILS:
- Transaction IDs: 1294, 1297, 1299, 1301, 1304, 1306, 9330, 13751
- All show session_id = NULL (cannot be terminated with KILL)
- Unallocated space blocked: 1,240 GB
- Growth impact: ~150 GB/day unable to reclaim

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Manual database failover to clear the orphaned transactions.

QUESTION:
Should we execute the failover ourselves during a maintenance window, or would you prefer to handle it from your side to ensure proper monitoring?

If we proceed:
- Command: az sql db failover --resource-group <rg> --server <server> --name <db>
- Expected downtime: 30-60 seconds
- Proposed window: Saturday, January 4, 2026 at 05:00-06:00 UTC (06:00-07:00 CET)
  Rationale: Post-ETL window, weekend, minimal user impact for analytics workload

Please advise on the best approach.

Attached: Diagnostic script and results.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
